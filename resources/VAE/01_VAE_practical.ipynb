        "   - CIFAR10: $C = 3$, $H = 32$, $W = 32$, so $D = 3 \\times 32 \\times 32 = 3072$.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The encoder and decoder MLPs will take vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ as input, so their first and last linear layers must be sized accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. With `transforms.ToTensor()`, pixel values lie in $[0, 1]$.  \n",
        "   This is compatible with:\n",
        "   - a Bernoulli likelihood on binarized pixels (or on $[0, 1]$ values using a cross-entropy-like loss),\n",
        "   - or a simple Gaussian likelihood with fixed variance and a mean constrained to $[0, 1]$ via a sigmoid.\n",
        "\n",
        "   In any case, knowing the range is important to choose an appropriate reconstruction loss.\n",

        "3. When switching to `CIFAR10`:\n",
        "   - $D$ increases from $784$ to $3072$, and the number of channels increases from $1$ to $3$.\n",
        "   - The data is RGB natural images instead of binary-like digits or clothing silhouettes.\n",

        "### Qualitative analysis - answers\n",
        "\n",
        "1. VAEs with simple MLP architectures typically capture:\n",
        "   - global shape and coarse structure (digit identity, clothing type, rough pose),\n",
        "   - approximate intensity or stroke thickness.\n",
        "\n",
        "   They tend to lose:\n",
        "   - fine details (sharp edges, small texture),\n",
        "   - high-frequency noise patterns,\n",
        "   - small variations that require high-capacity decoders or more expressive likelihoods.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The use of a factorized Bernoulli or Gaussian likelihood and the bottleneck in $z$\n",
        "   both push the model toward \"average-looking\" reconstructions rather than very crisp ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. If prior samples decoded from $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$ resemble the training data,\n",
        "   this suggests that the encoder has organized $q_\\phi(z \\mid x)$ around the prior\n",
        "   and that the decoder has learned a good mapping from latent space to data space.\n",
        "   If many samples look like noise or nonsense images, possibilities include:\n",
        "   - the latent space learned by the encoder is concentrated in a small region of $\\mathbb{R}^{d_z}$,\n",
        "     and sampling from the full prior sends $z$ into regions the decoder has not seen during training,\n",
        "   - insufficient training or model capacity,\n",
        "   - imbalance between reconstruction and KL terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In the 2D latent plot:\n",
        "   - clear clusters per class indicate that the encoder has learned to use $z$ to separate classes,\n",
        "     while the KL term still keeps the overall distribution roughly Gaussian-shaped,\n",
        "   - heavily overlapping clusters may reflect a strong KL term (posterior distributions pulled\n",
        "     too close to the prior) or insufficient model capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The KL regularization encourages the overall cloud of points to look roughly like a standard\n",
        "   normal, while the reconstruction objective encourages class structure to emerge within that cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. For a good VAE, latent interpolations:\n",
        "   - should produce a smooth series of images where high-level attributes (for example,\n",
        "     digit identity) change gradually,\n",
        "   - and each intermediate should look like a plausible example from the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "   If interpolations quickly produce unrealistic images, it may indicate that the straight line\n",
        "   in latent space leaves the \"data manifold\" region that the decoder was trained on, or that\n",

        "\n",
        "5. In a two-layer hierarchical VAE with $(z^{(2)}, z^{(1)})$ you could:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Plot the distribution of $z^{(2)}$ (for example, in 2D or via projections) to see whether\n",
        "     it captures global factors (for example, rough class or style).\n",
        "   - Condition on a fixed $z^{(2)}$ and look at the distribution of $z^{(1)}$ and the corresponding\n",
